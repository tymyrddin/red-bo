# Introduction

## What?

Buffer overflow attacks are code injection techniques that exploit an application's vulnerabilities to take control of execution flow. These attacks take advantage of programming errors that allow malicious input to overwrite parts of memory, resulting in unintended or malicious code execution.

## Why?

Buffer overflows are a common type of security vulnerability, particularly in legacy code or code not written with security in mind. They can be challenging to detect and exploit, but once successfully exploited, make complete control over the vulnerable system possible. Buffer overflows are one of the most common attacks used by malware and viruses to infect systems.
